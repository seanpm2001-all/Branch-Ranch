# April fools!

It is April 1st 2021. This is a non-traditional April Fools joke, in the sense that it isn't a fooled you joke. I haven't made very good April Fools joke in the past, and I decided to save this joke project for April Fools.

This repository is also for my practice on managing GitHub branches.
