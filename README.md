I am your master. Work for me peasant!

(In the Summer of 2020, Microsoft changed the default branch of GitHub from `master` to `main` to "remove a reference to slavery" even though it wasn't much of a big deal at all. It isn't a very big deal (this change wasn't) although actual companies using [Slavery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_labour_in_cocoa_production) still exist today (such as [Nestlé](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nestl%C3%A9#Slavery_and_child_labour) and something should REALLY be done about this. Nestlé is so evil, it is almost like a horrific cartoon. They are more evil than most cartoon villains, when compared, they are in the top 0.1% for evil.)
